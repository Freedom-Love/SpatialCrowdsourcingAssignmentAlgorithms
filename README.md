# Task Assignment Algorithms in Spatial Crowdsourcing

This is the project of task assignment algorithms in spatial crowdsourcing. 


To use this project, you need to build it as an Index.war package (Recommend to build with IntelliJ IDE), then use Apache Tomcat to run it as a web service, then use other scripts to call the functions.

As this project need to use the mysql container of the server project of gMission. Please make sure [gMission Server](https://github.com/gmission/gmission) has been setup with docker-compose first, then run this project.

Here is a Python project to generate experimental data sets and test the task assignment algorithms. Please visit [Spatial Crowdsourcing Task Assignment Python Client](https://github.com/gmission/SpatialCrowdsourcingExperimentClient).
